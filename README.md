AI EPITECH Project

Epitech project. Simulation of an autonomous car between the software CoppeliaSim and a C program.

Execute "coppeliaSim.sh" to open V-REP and open a .ttt file in the software. Do "make" to create the binary "ai". Execute "pipe.sh" to execute the program and look Coppelia.

Unfortunatly, CoppeliaSim isn't on the repository for the moment (space problem on repository).
