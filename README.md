### Prerequisites

To use this / test this, you'll need CoppeliaSim binary:

* [CoppeliaSim Download link isn't available for now!]

### Building program

Need4Stek is an AI project. You can build the project using:
```
$> make
```

Then, to launch and watch what's happening in the simulation, you have to launch CoppeliaSim and pipes.sh:
```
First Terminal:
  $> ./coppeliaSim.sh

Second Terminal:
  $> ./pipes.sh
```

Finnaly, you'll see your car move on coppeliaSim.
